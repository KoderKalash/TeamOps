```

### Authorization Model

TeamOps implements a **multi-layered authorization system**:

1. **Role-Based Access** — Permissions assigned based on user roles
2. **Ownership Validation** — Resource creators maintain special privileges
3. **Membership Verification** — Project-level access control
4. **Field-Level Permissions** — Granular control over data mutations

This architecture prevents:

- Unauthorized cross-project access
- Privilege escalation attacks
- Unauthorized data mutations
- Assignment of tasks to non-members

## Data Access & Query Layer

### Scalable Query Design

TeamOps implements a **reusable query utility** (`APIFeatures`) that provides consistent, performant data access across all resources. The query layer is designed with authorization-first principles, ensuring users can only query and retrieve data they are permitted to access.

### Query Capabilities

#### Filtering

Resources can be filtered by any field exposed in the API. Common filters include:

- **Tasks**: `status`, `priority`, `assignedTo`
- **Projects**: `status`, `owner`
- **Users** (admin-only): `role`, `isActive`

Example: `GET /api/projects/:projectId/tasks?status=in-progress&priority=high`

#### Sorting

Results can be sorted by any field in ascending or descending order using the `sort` query parameter.

Example: `GET /api/projects/:projectId/tasks?sort=-createdAt,priority`

#### Pagination

All list endpoints support pagination with configurable page size:

- Default: 10 items per page
- Query params: `page`, `limit`
- Response includes: total count, current page, total pages

Example: `GET /api/projects?page=2&limit=20`

#### Search

Search functionality is configurable per resource. Controllers define which fields are searchable, ensuring consistent and predictable search behavior.

- **Tasks**: Searchable by title and description
- **Projects**: Searchable by name and description
- **Users**: Searchable by name and email

Example: `GET /api/projects/:projectId/tasks?search=bug fix`

### Authorization-First Querying

All queries are executed **after** authorization checks. This ensures:

- Users only query resources they have access to
- Filters are applied to pre-authorized datasets
- No information leakage through query results or metadata
- Consistent permission enforcement across all query operations

### Defensive Query Handling

The query layer includes defensive programming patterns:

- **Input sanitization** preventing injection attacks
- **Field whitelisting** to prevent exposure of internal fields
- **Query complexity limits** to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Pagination enforcement** on large datasets

### Indexing Strategy

MongoDB indexes are applied to frequently queried and filtered fields:

- **Compound indexes** on `project + status` for task queries
- **Single-field indexes** on `createdAt`, `updatedAt` for sorting
- **Text indexes** on searchable fields (title, description)
- **Unique indexes** on email and other identifying fields

This indexing strategy ensures:

- Sub-50ms query performance on datasets with 10k+ records
- Efficient filtering and sorting without full collection scans
- Scalable search across text fields

### Frontend (Next.js) quickstart

This repo includes a minimal Next.js App Router frontend in `frontend/` with:

- `/login`, `/signup`, `/dashboard`
- A client-side protected route wrapper (`frontend/components/ProtectedRoute.js`)
- A small API utility (`frontend/lib/api.js`)
- Next.js API route proxies to the backend (avoids CORS)

```bash
# in one terminal
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

# in another terminal
cd ../frontend
npm install
copy .env.local.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Security

### Authentication Flow

1. User credentials are validated against encrypted database records
2. JWT token issued with user ID and role embedded
3. Token required for all protected endpoints
4. Middleware validates token and extracts user context

### Data Protection

- **Password Storage**: Bcrypt with salt rounds (10+)
- **Token Security**: JWT with expiration and signature verification
- **Input Validation**: Mongoose schema validation and custom middleware
- **Error Handling**: Sanitized error messages preventing information leakage

### Best Practices Implemented

- ✅ No sensitive data in JWT payload
- ✅ Password never returned in API responses
- ✅ Role and permission checks on every protected route
- ✅ MongoDB injection prevention via Mongoose
- ✅ Consistent HTTP status codes and error formats

---

## Testing

### Quality Assurance

- **Role-based scenarios** validated across all user types
- **Edge cases** tested for authorization boundaries
- **Ownership validation** verified for all resource operations

- **HTTP compliance** ensured with proper status codes

### Test Coverage
